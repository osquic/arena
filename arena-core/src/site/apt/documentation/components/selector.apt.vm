Selectors

 A <<org.uqbar.arena.widgets.Selector[T]>> is a control that displays a list of options and lets the user
 choose (select) one of them.
 
 Tipically it will look like what we commonly know as a ComboBox.

* Bindings

 A selector has two main properties that one must bind:
 
 * <<value:>> meaning the selected element
 
 * <<items:>> the list of options that it displays.

 []
  
 Through both "bind" methods you are able to connect this properties to the underlying model. This
 way it will automatically update the view upon chances in the model.
 
 Here's a sample in Java from the previous screenshot
 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Selector<Country> selector = new Selector<Country>(mainPanel);
selector.allowNull(false)
selector.bindValueToProperty("country");
selector.bindItemsToProperty("countries")
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This expects an underlying model object with two properties: a "country" with type Country
 and "countries" as a list/collection of Country objects.
 
 Here is the sample model in Scala

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
@Observable
class Country(var name:String)

@Observable
class Address {
   var country: Country = _
   var state: String = _
   var street: String = _
  
   def getCountries() =  List(
      new Country("Argentina"),
      new Country("Uruguay"),
      new Country("Bolivia"),
      new Country("North Korea")).asJava
   }
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Generic type
 
 Note that Selector[T] is a parametric type. Meaning that it has a generic parameter.
 This type must be the type of options or, what is the same, the type of element it allows
 you to select.
 
 In our example we show a list of Country and select one of them. Therefore it is a Select<Country>

* List

 The subclass <<org.uqbar.arena.widgets.List[T]>> has the same behavior as Selector but it shows up
 as a list, displaying all the values at the same time.

* RadioSelector

 Same as List, this shows up as a group of mutex radio buttons.
 
[../../images/radioSelector.png]

* Selection on Tables

 Tables also allows you (but does not force you) to bind a single selection to a model's property.
 See {{{./table.html}Tables}} section for that.
