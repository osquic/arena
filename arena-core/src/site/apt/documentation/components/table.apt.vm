Table

 A <<org.uqbar.arena.widgets.tables.Table[R]>> shows a table / grid with a list of elements of type R.

* Bindings

 A table must 
 
 * have at least one column
 
 * bind its property items against a collection of elements that match R type

* Another properties

 * It inherits the following properties from {{{./control.html}Control}}:
 
   * enabled, visible & background (bindables)
 
   * height / width (manually configured)
 
 * And also inherits from Skinnable Control this properties:
 
    * fontSize, foreground, background 

 * value (optional): type R - bind the selected element

* Example 

 A Table that shows a collection of customers in a Cell Phone company:

+--
var table = new Table<Customer>(mainPanel, typeof(Customer))
table.heigth = 200
table.width = 450
table.bindItemsToProperty("results")
table.bindValueToProperty("selectedCustomer")
+--

 Another example, using Xtend syntactic sugar: 

+--
var table = new Table<Customer>(mainPanel, typeof(Customer)) => [
   height = 200
   width = 450
   bindItemsToProperty("results")
   bindValueToProperty("selectedCustomer") 
]
+--

 Note the parallel relation between Table and Column models: the table has a <customer list> as a model, whereas every column has a <customer> as a model.
 
 And this is how we add a column with the name of every customer:

+--
new Column<Customer>(table) => [
   title = "Name"
   fixedSize = 150
   bindContentsToProperty("name")
]
+--

 A Customer has a String property name.
 
 If you want to adapt a property you can 

 * use a transformer
 
 * define a read-only property (eg: getXXX() method in the model)
